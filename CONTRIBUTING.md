# Contributing

Thanks for being here. SmolLLM Studio is a small, local-first tool and it should
stay that way. This document covers how to get a working dev loop and the rules
this repo is held to.

## Get set up

You need:

- Rust 1.77 or newer (`rustup show` should print the workspace's toolchain)
- Node.js 20+ and pnpm (`corepack enable` provides pnpm without a global
  install; there is no committed `packageManager` pin, so any recent pnpm works)
- Python 3 with Pillow, only if you want to regenerate the app icons
- The Tauri v2 system prerequisites for your OS:
  <https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smollm-studio/smollm-studio
cd smollm-studio
cargo build                          # workspace libraries + the smollm CLI
cd desktop && pnpm install           # frontend deps
pnpm tauri dev                       # native window + Vite on :1420
```

`pnpm dev` alone runs the UI in a browser with every command failing into its
error state. Useful for styling, useless for data — the Tauri IPC bridge does
not exist there.

The CLI is a first-class twin of the app, so most work can be verified without
a window at all:

```bash
cargo run -p smollm-cli --bin smollm -- hardware
cargo run -p smollm-cli --bin smollm -- models list
```

## Run the checks

CI enforces exactly these. Run them before you open a pull request — a green
`cargo test` is not enough on its own.

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all
cd desktop && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm build
```

Clippy is configured to fail on warnings, and `lint` runs with
`--max-warnings=0`. If a lint genuinely needs suppressing, use a scoped
`#[allow]`/`eslint-disable` with a one-line reason, never a blanket ignore.

## The rules that matter

These are not style preferences; they are the product's guarantees.

1. **No `unwrap()` in production code.** Tests and genuinely impossible
   invariants are the only exceptions, and they need a comment saying which.
2. **Avoid unnecessary `unsafe`.** If you think you need it, explain why in the
   PR before writing it.
3. **Never block the Tauri main thread.** Commands that do I/O or long-running
   work must be `async` and must not hold a lock across an `.await`.
4. **Use `tracing` for logs**, not `println!`/`dbg!`.
5. **No telemetry. Nothing leaves the machine except a model download from the
   registry you chose.** No analytics, no update pings, no crash reporting. A
   PR that adds an outbound request which isn't a user-initiated model fetch
   will be closed.
6. **Local by default.** Anything new must work with the network off; a network
   dependency is an explicit, opt-in feature.
7. **Do not rewrite inference.** Integration goes through the `Engine` trait in
   `crates/smollm-engine`. Adapters belong behind their feature flags
   (`llama-cpp`, `candle`) so the default build stays pure Rust and portable.
8. **If an API or dependency is uncertain, leave a clearly marked TODO adapter
   rather than breaking the build.** An honest seam beats a fake implementation.
9. **Be honest in user-visible copy.** Don't claim a capability the build doesn't
   have; see the README's "what is real, and what is a seam".

## Commits and pull requests

- **Semantic commit messages**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`,
  `perf:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `chore:`. Scope is optional but welcome —
  `fix(server): ...`.
- One logical change per commit. Keep `cargo fmt` output in the same commit as
  the code it formats.
- Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under "Unreleased" for anything user-facing.
- Describe what you verified, and how. For UI changes, say which theme you
  looked at — light is the default and it is easy to only ever test dark.

## Where to look first

- `crates/smollm-core` — the shared vocabulary: `AppError` and its codes,
  `Settings`, `AppPaths`.
- `crates/smollm-engine/src/lib.rs` — the `Engine` trait and `EngineManager`.
  Start here for any inference work.
- `crates/smollm-models` — catalog schema and the download manager.
- `desktop/src-tauri/src/commands.rs` — the command surface;
  `docs/api.md` lists all 29 with their events.
- `desktop/src/lib/api.ts` — the single place the frontend crosses into Rust.
  Keep the TS types mirroring the Rust structs.

Adding a Tauri command means touching all three: Rust command, `generate_handler!`
registration, and `api.ts`. Don't call `invoke` from a component directly.

## Get in touch

Open an issue before starting anything that changes the surface area (a new
page, a new command, a new backend flag, a dependency swap). SmolLLM Studio is
deliberately lightweight — "we could" is not the same as "we should".
