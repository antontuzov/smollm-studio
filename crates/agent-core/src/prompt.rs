//! The prompt, written for a model that has about a thousand tokens of patience.
//!
//! Everything the loop knows has to reach the model through these strings, so
//! their order is the design: what the model must not forget is at the top and is
//! short, the repository's table of contents comes before any file body, and the
//! tool list is only spelled out in prose when the provider cannot carry it
//! natively. A tool call is asked for as one JSON object, because that is the
//! shape this repository can read back out of a messy answer.
//!
//! The rendering functions here are pure and take the types from the caller, so
//! what the model saw on step four can be asserted in a test and printed by
//! `smoll chat --trace` without running anything.
