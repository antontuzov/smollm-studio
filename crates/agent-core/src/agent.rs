//! The loop: one task, one repository, one model that cannot hold all three.
//!
//! The order is the one the design asks for — context, plan, ask, act, observe,
//! reflect, and only then stop. Each turn is one request to one provider, so a
//! step can be retried, timed out, logged and repaired as a unit. Nothing here
//! decides whether a write is allowed: the policy in `agent_sandbox` answers that
//! before a tool is entered, and [`Approver`] answers only the question the
//! policy leaves for a person.
//!
//! Four properties the rest of the crate depends on:
//!
//! - **A refusal is an observation, not a crash.** The model is told in its own
//!   conversation what it may not do, and carries on. Only a person saying no, or
//!   a limit being reached, ends a run.
//! - **A write is undoable.** Every applied change is recorded in the [`Context`]
//!   journal and [`Agent::rollback`] puts the tree back. The loop never calls it
//!   on its own: a change a person has been shown is theirs to accept or undo.
//! - **Nothing is invented.** An answer that cannot be read gets one repair round
//!   quoting the model's own words back at it, and after that the run says so
//!   rather than guessing what the cut-off JSON meant to say.
//! - **The plan is the run's own scaffold.** It is written from the repository —
//!   the files the ranking chose, the project's validation command — and advanced
//!   as the steps happen, so a transcript can show where the run departed from it.
//!
//! Streaming is not emitted here: no provider in this build streams, so
//! [`AgentEvent::Delta`] waits for the engine adapter rather than being faked.
