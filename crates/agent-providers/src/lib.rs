//! One trait between the agent loop and whatever is answering it.
//!
//! The loop asks for a completion with tool schemas attached and gets back text
//! plus whatever calls it recognises — one answer per step, so a step can be
//! retried, timed out and logged as a unit.
//!
//! Behind the trait today sit the scripted mock and the echo provider, which is
//! what every test in this workspace runs against. The GGUF adapter onto this
//! repository's engine layer and the OpenAI-compatible HTTP client for Ollama,
//! LM Studio, vLLM, TGI, `llama-server` and this repo's own `smoll serve` are
//! the next step; asking for one before it is built returns
//! [`ProviderError::not_supported`] rather than a silent fallback to the mock,
//! because an agent that quietly answers from a script in place of your model is
//! worse than one that stops.
//!
//! Small models are the design centre, not an afterthought: tool calls are
//! parsed from native function calls, fenced JSON and plain text in that order,
//! a malformed answer gets one repair attempt, and a provider that cannot do
//! tool calling is not an error — it degrades the run into suggestion mode.
//!
//! ```
//! use agent_providers::{tool_calls, CompletionRequest, MockProvider, Provider, Reply, ToolSchema};
//! use serde_json::json;
//! use smollm_core::chat::{chat_message, Role};
//!
//! let provider = MockProvider::scripted([Reply::call("list_files", json!({"dir": "src"}))]);
//! let mut request = CompletionRequest::new(vec![chat_message(Role::User, "what is in src?")]);
//! request.tools = vec![ToolSchema::new(
//!     "list_files",
//!     "List a directory",
//!     json!({"type": "object", "properties": {"dir": {"type": "string"}}}),
//! )];
//!
//! let runtime = tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().expect("a test runtime");
//! let answer = runtime.block_on(provider.complete(&request)).expect("a scripted answer");
//! assert_eq!(answer.calls.len(), 1);
//! assert_eq!(answer.calls[0].name, "list_files");
//!
//! // The same reading works on raw text, which is how a prose answer from a
//! // model without tool calling still becomes a call.
//! assert_eq!(tool_calls(r#"{ "tool": "list_files", "dir": "src" }"#, &|_| true).len(), 1);
