//! What the agent can actually do, as data.
//!
//! A tool is a name, a description the model reads, a JSON Schema its arguments
//! are validated against, an intent the sandbox checks before anything runs, a
//! timeout and an output ceiling. The registry is the same list the CLI prints,
//! the set of schemas a provider embeds in its prompt, and the gate a call
//! passes through on its way to an implementation — so "what this agent is
//! capable of" has exactly one answer.
//!
//! This crate owns the implementations and nothing about the agent's reasoning:
//! a tool never decides whether it should have been called, and cannot widen
//! what it is allowed to touch. Seven of the nine tools read. The two that write
//! — `write_file` and `patch_file` — delegate the diff and the rollback to
//! `agent-repo`, and record what they replaced in [`Context::rollback`] so a run
//! that went wrong can be undone.
//!
//! ```
//! use agent_tools::{Context, Registry, ToolCall};
//! use serde_json::json;
//!
//! let registry = Registry::with_defaults();
//! let context = Context::new(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"));
//! let runtime = tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().expect("a runtime to run one call in");
//!
//! // A path that climbs out of the repository is refused before the filesystem
//! // is touched, and the answer says why.
//! let call = ToolCall::new("read_file", json!({"path": "../../../../etc/passwd"}));
//! let result = runtime.block_on(registry.execute(&call, &context));
//! assert!(!result.is_success());
//! assert!(result.summary().contains("climbs out"), "{}", result.summary());
//!
//! // A tool that does not exist is not an error to retry blindly: the answer
//! // names the ones that do.
//! let call = ToolCall::new("delete_repo", json!({}));
//! let result = runtime.block_on(registry.execute(&call, &context));
//! assert!(result.summary().contains("no tool named"), "{}", result.summary());
//! ```
