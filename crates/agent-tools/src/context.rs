//! Everything a tool needs from the run it is part of.
//!
//! A tool is given a workspace, a policy, a log and a journal, and nothing else:
//! no handle on the model, no way to widen its own permissions, no ambient
//! current directory to be surprised by. The paths a tool reports in an
//! [`crate::tool::Intent`] come from [`Context::resolve`], which is where a
//! `../` that climbs out of the repository stops being a path and becomes a
//! refusal.
//!
//! The journal is the part that belongs to the run rather than the call. A write
//! records what it replaced, so an agent that went wrong can be undone by the
//! same command that told it to go; and an approval is remembered here, so a
//! policy is asked once about a thing rather than once per retry of it.
