//! Whether this action may run, and who has to say yes before it does.
//!
//! Two independent gates, checked in this order and combined:
//!
//! - the **sandbox policy** asks "is this within the boundaries this
//!   configuration drew" — the workspace root, the per-tool allow and deny
//!   lists, and the commands no configuration is allowed to permit. Its verdict
//!   is softened by [`SandboxMode`]: `strict` blocks, `warn` runs the action and
//!   says out loud that it would have stopped it, `off` records and moves on.
//! - the **approval mode** asks "does a human have to answer first". It is not
//!   softened by anything, because it is the user's own line rather than a
//!   guard rail around the model.
//!
//! The distinction is what keeps the two features from cancelling each other
//! out. `sandbox = "off"` with `approval_mode = "approve-edits"` still asks
//! before writing a file, and `autonomous-safe` still refuses `sudo`.
